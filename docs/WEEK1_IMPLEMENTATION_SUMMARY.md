## System Architecture Overview

The AI Options Trading System implements a distributed microservices architecture designed for high availability, scalability, and real-time performance. The architecture consists of several key layers that work together to provide comprehensive trading capabilities.

### Core Infrastructure Layer

The foundation of the system rests on AWS cloud infrastructure, provisioned through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. This approach ensures reproducible, version-controlled infrastructure deployments that can be easily modified and scaled as requirements evolve. The infrastructure includes Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, providing both security and high availability.

The database layer utilizes TimescaleDB, a time-series extension of PostgreSQL, specifically chosen for its superior performance in handling high-volume time-series data typical in financial markets. TimescaleDB provides automatic partitioning, compression, and retention policies that are essential for managing the massive volumes of market data generated by options trading. The database is configured with hypertables for optimal time-series performance and includes comprehensive indexing strategies for rapid data retrieval.

Redis serves as the caching layer, providing sub-millisecond data access for frequently requested information such as current prices, recent analytics results, and user session data. The Redis implementation includes intelligent caching strategies with appropriate Time-To-Live (TTL) settings for different data types, ensuring optimal performance while maintaining data freshness.

### Microservices Layer

The application layer consists of four primary microservices, each designed with specific responsibilities and clear interfaces. The API Gateway serves as the central entry point, implementing authentication, rate limiting, circuit breakers, and intelligent routing to downstream services. This design provides a unified interface for clients while enabling independent scaling and deployment of individual services.

The Data Ingestion Service handles all market data collection and processing, including real-time feeds from Databento and historical data retrieval. The service implements sophisticated error handling, data validation, and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data flow even during market volatility or network disruptions. For development and testing purposes, the service includes a comprehensive mock data generator that produces realistic market data patterns.

The Analytics Service provides the computational engine for technical analysis, pattern recognition, and options analytics. It implements a wide range of technical indicators including moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and custom volatility measures. The service also includes advanced pattern recognition algorithms for identifying support and resistance levels, trend analysis, and breakout detection.

The Cache Service acts as an intelligent data layer between the database and other services, implementing sophisticated caching strategies that optimize for both performance and data consistency. The service provides APIs for storing and retrieving various data types with appropriate expiration policies and cache invalidation strategies.

### Monitoring and Observability Layer

The system includes comprehensive monitoring and observability capabilities built around Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. The monitoring stack captures detailed metrics from all services including response times, error rates, throughput, and business-specific metrics such as trading signal generation rates and market data processing volumes.

Structured logging is implemented across all services using a centralized configuration that supports multiple output formats including JSON for machine processing and human-readable formats for development. The logging system includes access logs, audit trails, and performance metrics, providing complete visibility into system operations.

## Implementation Details

### AWS Infrastructure Implementation

The Terraform infrastructure code provides a complete AWS environment optimized for financial trading applications. The implementation includes a multi-AZ VPC with carefully designed network segmentation that separates public-facing components from sensitive data processing services.

The Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster is configured with Fargate launch type, providing serverless container execution that automatically scales based on demand. This approach eliminates the need for EC2 instance management while providing the flexibility to scale individual services independently based on their specific load patterns.

The RDS implementation uses PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extensions, configured with Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and automated backups for data protection. The database is sized appropriately for the expected data volumes, with the ability to scale both vertically and horizontally as the system grows.

ElastiCache provides managed Redis clusters with automatic failover and backup capabilities. The Redis configuration is optimized for the specific access patterns of financial data, with appropriate memory allocation and eviction policies.

### Database Schema and Data Management

The TimescaleDB schema is designed specifically for high-frequency financial data storage and retrieval. The primary tables include stock_ohlcv for price data, stock_trades for individual trade records, stock_quotes for bid/ask information, and options_chains for options-specific data.

Each table is configured as a hypertable with time-based partitioning, enabling efficient data insertion and querying across large time ranges. The partitioning strategy is optimized for the typical query patterns in algorithmic trading, where recent data is accessed most frequently and historical data is used for backtesting and analysis.

Comprehensive indexing strategies are implemented to support rapid data retrieval for various query patterns. Composite indexes on symbol and timestamp combinations enable efficient filtering and sorting operations, while specialized indexes support analytics queries that aggregate data across multiple time periods.

Data retention policies are configured to automatically manage storage costs while maintaining sufficient historical data for analysis. The policies implement a tiered approach where recent data is kept at full resolution while older data is compressed and eventually archived or deleted based on business requirements.

### Databento Integration and Mock Data Pipeline

The Databento integration provides access to institutional-quality market data with microsecond timestamps and comprehensive options coverage. The implementation includes both live streaming and historical data retrieval capabilities, with robust error handling and reconnection logic to maintain data continuity during network disruptions.

For development and testing purposes, a sophisticated mock data generator creates realistic market data that closely mimics actual trading patterns. The generator produces correlated price movements, realistic volume patterns, and appropriate options pricing relationships. This capability enables comprehensive testing and development without requiring expensive market data subscriptions during the development phase.

The data pipeline implements comprehensive validation and quality checks to ensure data integrity. Invalid or suspicious data points are flagged and either corrected or excluded from processing, maintaining the high data quality essential for reliable trading decisions.

### Analytics Engine Implementation

The analytics engine implements a comprehensive suite of technical indicators and pattern recognition algorithms specifically chosen for options trading applications. The implementation uses optimized numerical libraries including NumPy and TA-Lib for efficient computation of technical indicators.

The technical indicators include traditional measures such as Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Additionally, the system implements more sophisticated indicators including Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillators, and Average True Range (ATR) calculations.

Pattern recognition algorithms identify key market structures including support and resistance levels, trend analysis, and breakout detection. The algorithms use statistical methods to identify significant price levels and trend changes, providing the foundation for trading signal generation.

Options-specific analytics include implied volatility surface calculations, Greeks computation (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho), and volatility analysis. These calculations are essential for options trading strategies and provide insights into market sentiment and pricing inefficiencies.

### Caching Strategy and Performance Optimization

The Redis caching implementation uses intelligent strategies tailored to different data types and access patterns. Stock prices are cached with short TTL values (5 minutes) to balance performance with data freshness requirements. Analytics results are cached with longer TTL values (15 minutes) since technical indicators change more slowly than raw prices.

The caching layer implements cache warming strategies that preload frequently accessed data during off-market hours, ensuring optimal performance when markets open. Cache invalidation strategies ensure that stale data is removed promptly when new information becomes available.

Performance optimization includes connection pooling for database and Redis connections, asynchronous processing for non-critical operations, and efficient data serialization using optimized JSON encoding. These optimizations ensure that the system can handle high-frequency trading requirements with minimal latency.

## Containerization and Deployment
