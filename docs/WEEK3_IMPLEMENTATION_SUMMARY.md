## Architecture Overview

### Service Architecture

The Portfolio Management Service follows a microservices architecture pattern, designed for scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance. The service is built using Flask as the web framework, providing a RESTful API interface for all portfolio management operations. The architecture incorporates several key components that work together to provide comprehensive portfolio management capabilities.

The core service layer handles all portfolio operations including creation, position management, and portfolio lifecycle management. This layer maintains the state of all portfolios and provides the primary interface for external services to interact with portfolio data. The service layer is designed to be stateless where possible, with all persistent state maintained in the database layer.

The IBKR integration layer provides seamless connectivity to Interactive Brokers' Trader Workstation (TWS) API, enabling real-time market data access and order execution capabilities. This layer implements sophisticated connection management, automatic reconnection logic, and runtime account switching capabilities that allow traders to seamlessly move between paper trading and live trading environments without service interruption.

The position sizing engine implements multiple sophisticated algorithms for determining optimal position sizes based on signal confidence, portfolio risk metrics, and diversification requirements. This engine considers multiple factors including Kelly criterion calculations, risk parity principles, volatility adjustments, and confidence-weighted scaling to ensure that each position is appropriately sized for the portfolio's risk profile and investment objectives.

The portfolio optimization engine provides advanced mathematical optimization capabilities using modern portfolio theory principles. This engine can optimize portfolios across multiple objectives including maximum Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, maximum return, risk parity, maximum diversification, and Black-Litterman approaches. The optimization engine incorporates sophisticated constraint handling for weight limits, sector exposure limits, turnover constraints, and risk budgets.

### Data Architecture

The data architecture is built on a foundation of PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extensions for time-series data management. This combination provides the relational database capabilities needed for portfolio and position management while offering optimized storage and querying for time-series market data and performance metrics.

The database schema is designed to support multiple portfolios per account, with each portfolio maintaining its own set of positions, performance history, and risk metrics. The schema includes comprehensive audit trails for all portfolio operations, enabling detailed analysis of portfolio changes over time and supporting regulatory compliance requirements.

Redis is used as a high-performance caching layer for frequently accessed data including real-time market prices, portfolio snapshots, and calculated metrics. The caching strategy is designed to minimize database load while ensuring data consistency and freshness for real-time operations.

The data flow architecture ensures that all portfolio operations are properly sequenced and that data consistency is maintained across all components. The service implements optimistic locking for portfolio updates and uses database transactions to ensure that complex operations either complete successfully or are rolled back entirely.

### Integration Architecture

The Portfolio Management Service is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the AI Options Trading System. It consumes signals from the Signal Generation Service implemented in Week 2, providing the bridge between signal generation and actual portfolio implementation.

The service exposes comprehensive APIs for integration with the Risk Management Service planned for Week 4, providing real-time portfolio data, risk metrics, and position information needed for advanced risk monitoring and control.

## Core Components Implementation

### IBKR Integration with Runtime Account Switching

The Interactive Brokers integration represents one of the most sophisticated components of the Portfolio Management Service. This integration provides seamless connectivity to IBKR's Trader Workstation API while implementing advanced features for runtime account switching and comprehensive risk management.

The IBKR client implementation provides a robust wrapper around the native IBKR API, handling connection management, message routing, and error recovery. The client maintains persistent connections to the TWS or IB Gateway, implementing automatic reconnection logic to handle network interruptions or API disconnections. The connection management system includes sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the IBKR infrastructure during connection issues.

The account management system enables runtime switching between different IBKR accounts without requiring service restart or interruption of other portfolio operations. This capability is essential for traders who need to move between paper trading environments for testing and live trading environments for actual execution. The account switching process includes comprehensive validation of account permissions, trading capabilities, and risk limits before completing the switch.

The account configuration system supports multiple account profiles with different risk parameters, trading limits, and allowed instruments. Each account profile includes maximum order values, daily trade limits, allowed symbols, and sector restrictions. This configuration-driven approach enables fine-grained control over trading activities and helps prevent unauthorized or excessive trading.

The order management system provides comprehensive order lifecycle management including order placement, modification, cancellation, and status tracking. The system supports multiple order types including market orders, limit orders, stop orders, and stop-limit orders. Order validation includes pre-trade risk checks, position limit validation, and symbol restriction enforcement.

The market data integration provides real-time streaming of market data for all portfolio positions and watchlist symbols. The market data system handles subscription management, data normalization, and distribution to other service components. The system includes sophisticated error handling for market data interruptions and implements automatic resubscription logic to ensure continuous data flow.

### Position Sizing Algorithms

The position sizing engine implements seven sophisticated algorithms for determining optimal position sizes based on multiple factors including signal confidence, portfolio risk metrics, and diversification requirements. Each algorithm is designed to address different aspects of portfolio construction and risk management.

The confidence-weighted sizing method serves as the default algorithm and scales position sizes based on signal confidence levels. This method applies a confidence adjustment factor that ranges from 0.7x for low confidence signals (0.6) to 1.5x for high confidence signals (0.9). The algorithm also incorporates risk adjustments based on portfolio volatility, position concentration, and market regime factors.

The Kelly criterion implementation provides mathematically optimal position sizing based on the expected win rate and risk-reward ratio of each signal. The algorithm calculates the Kelly fraction using the formula: f = (bp - q) / b, where b is the odds received on the wager, p is the probability of winning, and q is the probability of losing. The implementation includes a fractional Kelly approach that applies only a percentage of the full Kelly recommendation to reduce volatility.

The risk parity algorithm ensures that each position contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk. This approach calculates position sizes based on the inverse of each asset's volatility, scaled to achieve equal risk contribution. The algorithm includes correlation adjustments to account for the interaction effects between positions.

The volatility-adjusted sizing method scales position sizes inversely to asset volatility, providing larger allocations to lower volatility assets and smaller allocations to higher volatility assets. This approach helps maintain consistent risk levels across different types of assets and market conditions.

The optimal F algorithm maximizes the geometric growth rate of the portfolio by optimizing position sizes based on the historical performance distribution of each strategy. This method uses the complete return distribution rather than just the mean and variance, providing more robust sizing decisions for strategies with non-normal return distributions.

The fixed dollar and fixed percentage methods provide simpler alternatives for traders who prefer consistent position sizing approaches. These methods ensure predictable position sizes and are useful for strategies that require consistent exposure levels regardless of market conditions or signal characteristics.

### Portfolio Optimization Engine

The portfolio optimization engine implements six advanced optimization objectives using modern portfolio theory principles and sophisticated mathematical optimization techniques. The engine is built on the CVXPY optimization framework, providing access to state-of-the-art convex optimization solvers.

The maximum Sharpe ratio optimization serves as the primary optimization objective, seeking to maximize the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio. This optimization balances expected returns against portfolio volatility to find the allocation that provides the highest return per unit of risk. The implementation includes sophisticated handling of the non-convex nature of the Sharpe ratio optimization through iterative approaches and approximation methods.

The minimum variance optimization focuses on risk reduction by finding the portfolio allocation that minimizes overall portfolio volatility. This approach is particularly useful during periods of market uncertainty or when capital preservation is the primary objective. The optimization includes correlation matrix estimation and handles potential numerical issues with near-singular covariance matrices.

The maximum return optimization seeks to maximize expected portfolio returns subject to risk and diversification constraints. This approach is useful when return generation is the primary objective and risk tolerance is relatively high. The optimization includes robust return estimation techniques to handle the inherent uncertainty in return forecasts.

The risk parity optimization ensures that each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk. This approach has gained popularity due to its diversification benefits and reduced dependence on return forecasts. The implementation uses iterative algorithms to solve the non-convex risk parity optimization problem.

The maximum diversification optimization maximizes the diversification ratio, which is the ratio of the weighted average volatility of portfolio components to the portfolio volatility. This approach seeks to maximize the diversification benefits of the portfolio construction process.

The Black-Litterman optimization provides a Bayesian approach to portfolio optimization that combines market equilibrium assumptions with investor views. This method addresses many of the practical issues with traditional mean-variance optimization by providing more stable and intuitive portfolio allocations.

The constraint handling system supports comprehensive portfolio constraints including individual asset weight limits, sector exposure limits, turnover constraints, and risk budget constraints. The constraint system is designed to be flexible and configurable, allowing different constraint sets for different portfolio types and investment mandates.

### Risk Budgeting System

The risk budgeting system provides sophisticated risk allocation and monitoring capabilities across multiple dimensions including strategies, sectors, symbols, and time horizons. The system implements six different allocation types and six risk metrics to provide comprehensive risk management capabilities.

The equal risk allocation ensures that each entity receives an equal share of the total risk budget. This approach provides balanced risk exposure across all entities and is useful when there is no strong preference for particular strategies or sectors. The allocation is dynamically adjusted based on changing market conditions and portfolio composition.

The volatility-weighted allocation scales risk allocations based on the inverse of entity volatility, providing larger risk budgets to lower volatility entities and smaller budgets to higher volatility entities. This approach helps maintain consistent risk-adjusted exposure across entities with different volatility characteristics.

The confidence-weighted allocation scales risk budgets based on signal confidence levels or strategy performance metrics. Entities with higher confidence signals or better historical performance receive larger risk allocations. This approach helps concentrate risk in the most promising opportunities while maintaining diversification.

The strategy-weighted allocation distributes risk budgets based on strategy performance metrics and capacity constraints. Strategies with better risk-adjusted returns and higher capacity receive larger risk allocations. This approach helps optimize the overall portfolio performance by allocating more risk to the most effective strategies.

The sector-weighted allocation ensures appropriate diversification across market sectors by limiting the concentration of risk in any single sector. This approach helps reduce portfolio sensitivity to sector-specific events and provides more stable performance across different market environments.

The custom allocation type allows for user-defined allocation rules based on specific investment mandates or risk preferences. This flexibility enables the system to accommodate different investment approaches and regulatory requirements.

The risk metrics system supports six different risk measures including volatility, Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% and 99% confidence levels, Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR), maximum drawdown, and beta-adjusted exposure. Each risk metric provides different insights into portfolio risk characteristics and enables comprehensive risk monitoring.

The dynamic monitoring system tracks risk utilization in real-time and provides alerts when risk budgets approach or exceed their allocated limits. The system includes sophisticated violation detection and automatic rebalancing recommendations to maintain risk budgets within acceptable ranges.

### Real-time Portfolio Monitoring

The real-time portfolio monitoring system provides comprehensive tracking of portfolio performance, risk metrics, and position-level details with sub-second update frequencies. The monitoring system is designed to handle multiple portfolios simultaneously while maintaining high performance and data accuracy.

The portfolio snapshot system captures complete portfolio state at regular intervals, including total value, position details, profit and loss calculations, and risk metrics. Snapshots are generated every second during market hours and stored in a rolling buffer that maintains 30 days of historical data. The snapshot system includes data compression and efficient storage mechanisms to minimize memory usage while maintaining fast access to historical data.

The profit and loss tracking system provides real-time calculation of unrealized and realized P&L at both position and portfolio levels. The system tracks daily P&L, total P&L since inception, and provides detailed breakdowns by strategy, sector, and symbol. P&L calculations include accurate handling of corporate actions, dividends, and other adjustments that affect position values.

The performance analytics system calculates twelve comprehensive performance metrics including total return, annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, Value at Risk, Calmar ratio, and return distribution statistics. These metrics are calculated using rolling windows of different lengths to provide both short-term and long-term performance perspectives.

The risk monitoring system tracks portfolio-level risk metrics in real-time, including portfolio volatility, beta, correlation with market indices, and concentration metrics. The system provides alerts when risk metrics exceed predefined thresholds and includes trend analysis to identify developing risk issues before they become critical.

The position monitoring system tracks individual position performance, including unrealized P&L, position size relative to portfolio, time since entry, and position-specific risk metrics. The system provides detailed position analytics including maximum favorable excursion (MFE) and maximum adverse excursion (MAE) to help evaluate position management effectiveness.

### Performance Attribution Analysis

The performance attribution system provides comprehensive analysis of portfolio returns across multiple dimensions including strategies, sectors, symbols, and risk factors. The system implements five different attribution methodologies to provide robust and comprehensive attribution analysis.

The Brinson-Hood-Beebower attribution method serves as the industry standard approach, decomposing portfolio returns into allocation effects, selection effects, and interaction effects. The allocation effect measures the impact of over or under-weighting different segments relative to a benchmark. The selection effect measures the impact of security selection within each segment. The interaction effect captures the combined impact of allocation and selection decisions.

The arithmetic attribution method provides a simpler additive decomposition of portfolio returns, making it easier to understand and communicate attribution results. This method is particularly useful for shorter time periods and when the focus is on absolute contribution rather than relative performance.

The geometric attribution method provides more accurate attribution for longer time periods by properly handling the compounding effects of returns. This method is essential for annual attribution analysis and provides more accurate results when returns are volatile or when the analysis period is extended.

The interaction attribution method focuses specifically on the interaction effects between allocation and selection decisions. This analysis helps identify when allocation and selection decisions reinforce each other positively or negatively, providing insights for improving the portfolio construction process.

The Fama-French factor attribution method decomposes portfolio returns based on academic factor models including market, size, value, profitability, and investment factors. This approach provides insights into the sources of portfolio returns from a factor perspective and helps identify factor exposures that may not be apparent from traditional sector or strategy attribution.

The attribution system supports multiple levels of analysis including strategy-level attribution, sector-level attribution, symbol-level attribution, and factor-level attribution. Each level provides different insights into portfolio performance and helps identify the sources of outperformance or underperformance.

The top contributors and detractors analysis automatically identifies the positions, strategies, or sectors that contributed most positively or negatively to portfolio performance. This analysis includes both absolute contribution and risk-adjusted contribution metrics to provide comprehensive insights into performance drivers.
